# ask a Virtual Assistant these questions:

"""  Whats the difference between an instance method and a static method?

   An instance method works on a specific object and takes self as its first paramter a static method does not depend on
   object and doesn't take self"""

""" Why are static methods called static?

they are called static because they don't change or depend on the objects state they stay the same no matter which
object or class calls them"""
